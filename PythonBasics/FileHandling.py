# WHAT IS FILE HANDLING?
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# File handling means reading data FROM files and writing data INTO files.
# In real projects, you almost always need to:
#   - Save data so it is not lost when the program closes
#   - Read data from files created by someone else (CSV reports, JSON APIs)
#   - Write log files to track what happened in the program
#
# Python makes this very easy with just one built-in function: open()
# And two standard library modules: csv  and  json

import csv
import json

# We will use simple, direct file paths in this file.
# Since YOU create the folders, just make sure this script sits inside
# filehandling_project/ and the paths below will work.

# =============================================================================
# PART 1 — TEXT FILE HANDLING (.txt)
# =============================================================================
#
# WHAT IS A TEXT FILE?
#   The simplest type of file. Stores plain readable text.
#   Opens in Notepad, VS Code, any text editor.
#   Each line inside the file ends with a hidden character called \n
#   (newline). That's what tells the computer "start a new line here".
#
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# THE open() FUNCTION — the only thing you need to work with files
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
#   open("path/to/file",  "mode",  encoding="utf-8")
#          ↑                ↑              ↑
#     file location     what to do    handle special
#                       with it       characters safely
#
# FILE MODES — the second argument tells Python what you want to do:
#
#   "r"  → READ       Open the file and READ it. File must already exist.
#                     If file doesn't exist → FileNotFoundError crash.
#
#   "w"  → WRITE      Create a new file and WRITE into it.
#                     ⚠️  If file already exists → it gets DELETED and recreated!
#                     Use carefully.
#
#   "a"  → APPEND     Open file and ADD content at the END.
#                     Does NOT delete existing content.
#                     If file doesn't exist → creates a new one.
#
#   "x"  → CREATE     Create a brand new file.
#                     If file already exists → gives an error (safe mode).
#
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# THE "with" STATEMENT — always use this when opening files
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
#   with open("file.txt", "r") as f:
#       content = f.read()
#
#   WHY use "with"?
#   When you open a file, Python "holds" it open (locks it).
#   If your code crashes in the middle, the file stays locked — bad!
#   "with" automatically CLOSES the file when you're done, no matter what.
#   Think of it like this: "with" = try + finally + file.close() all in one.
#
#   The variable after "as" (we use 'f') is the file object.
#   You call methods on it: f.read(), f.write(), etc.

# 1A. READING a text file — 4 ways
# =============================================================================

section("1A. READ — Reading a text file")

# ── TINY EXAMPLE FIRST ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Imagine data/txt/intro.txt contains:
#   Hello, this is a simple text file.
#   Python makes reading and writing files very easy.
#   This file has multiple lines.
#   Each line can be read separately.
#   End of file.

# ─── WAY 1: f.read() — gets the WHOLE file as ONE big string ─────────────────
# Use this when: you want everything at once, file is small.
print("\n--- WAY 1: f.read() — entire file as one string ---")

with open("data/txt/intro.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    content = f.read()      # reads EVERYTHING — one giant string

print(content)
# Output:
# Hello, this is a simple text file.
# Python makes reading and writing files very easy.
# ...

print(f"Data type returned: {type(content)}")   # <class 'str'>
print(f"Total characters : {len(content)}")


# ─── WAY 2: f.readlines() — gets ALL lines as a LIST ────────────────────────
# Use this when: you want to work with individual lines, small file.
# Each item in the list = one line from the file (including the \n at the end).
print("\n--- WAY 2: f.readlines() — all lines as a list ---")

with open("data/txt/intro.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    lines = f.readlines()   # returns: ["line1\n", "line2\n", "line3\n", ...]

print(lines)
# Output: ['Hello, this is a simple text file.\n', 'Python makes....\n', ...]

print(f"Data type returned  : {type(lines)}")    # <class 'list'>
print(f"Number of lines     : {len(lines)}")
print(f"First line          : {lines[0].strip()}")   # .strip() removes the \n
print(f"Last line           : {lines[-1].strip()}")


# ─── WAY 3: f.readline() — reads ONE line at a time ──────────────────────────
# Use this when: you want to process one line at a time manually.
# Every call to readline() moves forward to the next line.
print("\n--- WAY 3: f.readline() — one line at a time ---")

with open("data/txt/intro.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    first_line  = f.readline()   # reads line 1, cursor moves to line 2
    second_line = f.readline()   # reads line 2, cursor moves to line 3
    third_line  = f.readline()   # reads line 3

print(f"Line 1 → {first_line.strip()}")
print(f"Line 2 → {second_line.strip()}")
print(f"Line 3 → {third_line.strip()}")


# ─── WAY 4: Loop directly over the file (BEST PRACTICE for large files) ──────
# Use this when: file is large (thousands of lines), you process line by line.
# This does NOT load the whole file into memory at once — very efficient.
# enumerate(f, start=1) gives you a line number alongside each line.
print("\n--- WAY 4: Loop line by line (best for large files) ---")

with open("data/txt/intro.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    for line_number, line in enumerate(f, start=1):
        clean_line = line.strip()    # remove \n from the end
        print(f"  Line {line_number}: {clean_line}")

# Output:
#   Line 1: Hello, this is a simple text file.
#   Line 2: Python makes reading and writing files very easy.
#   ...

# =============================================================================
# 1C. APPEND — Adding to a file without deleting existing content
# =============================================================================

section("1C. APPEND — Adding to an existing file")

# ─── TINY EXAMPLE: what append looks like ────────────────────────────────────
# "a" mode = ADD to the end. Never deletes existing content.
# If the file doesn't exist yet — "a" creates it (like "w").
print("\n--- Append mode demo ---")

# Step 1: create the file with some initial content
with open("output/log.txt", "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    f.write("=== Application Log ===\n")
    f.write("Log started.\n")

print("Initial file created.")

# Step 2: append more lines later (imagine this runs later in the day)
with open("output/log.txt", "a", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    f.write("Entry: User logged in.\n")
    f.write("Entry: File uploaded successfully.\n")

# Step 3: append even more later
with open("output/log.txt", "a", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    f.write("Entry: User logged out.\n")

print("One more entry appended.")

# Read the final file — you will see ALL entries, nothing was deleted
with open("output/log.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:

    print(f.read())

# Output:
# === Application Log ===
# Log started.

# =============================================================================
# PART 2 — CSV FILE HANDLING (.csv)
# =============================================================================
#
# WHAT IS A CSV FILE?
#   CSV = Comma-Separated Values.
#   It's basically a spreadsheet (like Excel) stored as plain text.
#   Open it in Notepad and you'll see rows of data separated by commas:
#
#     name,age,marks,grade       ← this is the header row (column names)
#     Yash,20,92,A+              ← this is a data row
#     Prashant,21,78,A
#     Rohit,19,55,C
#
# WHY use Python's csv MODULE instead of reading manually?
#   You might think: "I'll just split each line by comma!"
#   Problem: what if a value itself contains a comma?
#     e.g.  "Smith, John",25,90,A+
#   Splitting by comma would break "Smith, John" into two pieces.
#   The csv module handles ALL edge cases correctly and safely.
#
# The 4 things you use:
#   csv.reader     → read a CSV → each row comes back as a LIST
#   csv.DictReader → read a CSV → each row comes back as a DICT (column name → value)
#   csv.writer     → write a CSV from LISTS
#   csv.DictWriter → write a CSV from DICTS
#
# IMPORTANT: Always use  newline=""  when opening CSV files.
#   Without it, on Windows you get extra blank lines between every row.
#   This is a CSV-specific rule — you don't need it for txt or json files.


# =============================================================================
# 2A. READ CSV — Using csv.reader (rows as lists)
# =============================================================================

section("2A. CSV READ — csv.reader (rows as lists)")

    # next() reads one row and moves forward — so the loop starts from row 2.
    header = next(reader)

# - It reads the first row as keys (column names) automatically

# =============================================================================
# PART 3 — JSON FILE HANDLING (.json)
# =============================================================================
#
# WHAT IS JSON?
#   JSON = JavaScript Object Notation.
#   It's the most popular format for storing structured data on the internet.
#   Every modern API (weather, maps, payments) sends data as JSON.
#
#   JSON looks almost exactly like Python — that's why it's so easy to use!
#
#   JSON format   ←→   Python equivalent
#   ─────────────────────────────────────
#   { }           ←→   dict   {}
#   [ ]           ←→   list   []
#   "hello"       ←→   str    "hello"
#   42            ←→   int    42
#   3.14          ←→   float  3.14
#   true / false  ←→   True / False
#   null          ←→   None
#
# Example JSON file (student.json):
#   {
#       "name": "Yash",
#       "age": 20,
#       "marks": { "Python": 92, "Maths": 88 },
#       "passed": true
#   }
#
# The 4 json functions (easy to remember):
#
#   READING:
#   json.load(file)      → read JSON from a FILE       → gives Python dict/list
#   json.loads(string)   → read JSON from a STRING     → gives Python dict/list
#     ("loads" = load from String)
#
#   WRITING:
#   json.dump(data, file) → write Python data to a FILE as JSON
#   json.dumps(data)      → convert Python data to a JSON STRING (no file)
#     ("dumps" = dump to String)
