#  PYTHON OOP — Object Oriented Programming — Complete Reference Guide
#  Author  : Yash
#  Purpose : Understand OOP in Python from scratch, step by step
# =============================================================================


# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHAT IS OOP?
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) is a programming paradigm — a style or
# way of thinking about and writing code — where you model your program around
# "objects" that represent real-world or conceptual things.
#
# Before OOP, code was written in a PROCEDURAL style: just a list of
# instructions executed top-to-bottom, using plain functions and variables.
# OOP solves this by organizing code into self-contained units (objects) that
# hold BOTH data and the functions that operate on that data.
#
# WHY USE OOP?
#   ✅ Organizes large codebases into manageable pieces
#   ✅ Avoids repetition via code reuse (inheritance)
#   ✅ Protects sensitive data (encapsulation)
#   ✅ Makes code extensible and easier to maintain
#   ✅ Maps closely to how we think about real-world entities
#
# Real-world analogy:
#   A "Car" is a CLASS  — the blueprint or design on paper.
#   Your specific red Honda City is an OBJECT — one built from that blueprint.
#   colour, speed, brand  → ATTRIBUTES (data the object holds / "what it knows")
#   drive(), brake()      → METHODS    (things the object can do / "what it does")
#
# Think of it this way:
#   CLASS  = Cookie cutter  (the mold, used to define the shape)
#   OBJECT = Cookie         (the actual thing created from the mold)
#   You can make many cookies (objects) from one cookie cutter (class).
#
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# 4 Pillars of OOP (memorize these):
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
#   1. ENCAPSULATION  — Wrap data + methods into one unit (a class).
#                       Hide internal details so outside code can't accidentally
#                       break them. Like a capsule pill: you take the medicine
#                       without needing to know the chemical formula.
#
#   2. INHERITANCE    — A child class automatically gets all attributes and
#                       methods of its parent class. Avoids rewriting common
#                       code. Like how a child inherits traits from a parent.
#
#   3. POLYMORPHISM   — "Poly" = many, "morph" = form.
#                       The same method name can behave differently depending
#                       on which object calls it. Like how "speak()" means
#                       barking for a Dog but meowing for a Cat.
#
#   4. ABSTRACTION    — Hide the complex implementation; expose only a simple
#                       interface. Like driving a car — you press the pedal
#                       without knowing how the engine works internally.


# =============================================================================
# 1. CLASS AND OBJECT
# =============================================================================
#
# CLASS  → A blueprint or template that defines:
#           - What DATA (attributes) the objects will hold
#           - What BEHAVIOUR (methods) the objects will have
#           It does not occupy memory by itself — it's just a definition.
#
# OBJECT → An INSTANCE of a class. A concrete, specific thing created from
#           the blueprint. Each object has its own copy of the attributes.
#           Creating an object is called "instantiation".
#
# KEY POINT: You define a class ONCE but can create MANY objects from it.
#            Each object is completely independent — changing one doesn't
#            affect another.

# ── Define a class ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
class Dog:
    # __init__ is the CONSTRUCTOR — a special method that runs automatically
    # the moment an object is created. It sets up the object's initial state.
    #
    # 'self' is a reference to the object being created. Python passes it
    # automatically — you never pass it yourself when calling the method.
    # Think of 'self' as "this very object I am right now".
    def __init__(self, name, breed, age):
        self.name  = name    # instance attribute: each dog has its own name
        self.breed = breed   # instance attribute: each dog has its own breed
        self.age   = age     # instance attribute: each dog has its own age

    def bark(self):
        # 'self' lets the method access the object's own data
        print(f"{self.name} says: Woof!")

    def info(self):
        print(f"Name: {self.name} | Breed: {self.breed} | Age: {self.age}")


# ── Create objects (instances) ────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Calling the class like a function triggers __init__ automatically.
dog1 = Dog("Bruno",  "Labrador", 3)         # Object 1
dog2 = Dog("Sheru",  "Pomeranian", 5)       # Object 2
dog3 = Dog("Tommy",  "German Shepherd", 2)  # Object 3

# Access attributes using dot notation: object.attribute
print(dog1.name)     # Bruno
print(dog2.breed)    # Pomeranian

# Call methods using dot notation: object.method()
dog1.bark()          # Bruno says: Woof!
dog2.info()          # Name: Sheru | Breed: Pomeranian | Age: 5

# Objects are INDEPENDENT — modifying one has no effect on others
dog1.name = "Max"    # only dog1 is changed
print(dog1.name)     # Max
print(dog2.name)     # Sheru  — still unchanged

# Useful built-in checks
print(type(dog1))              # <class '__main__.Dog'>
print(isinstance(dog1, Dog))   # True — dog1 is an instance of Dog


# =============================================================================
# 2. __init__ METHOD (Constructor)
# =============================================================================
#
# DEFINITION:
#   __init__ is Python's CONSTRUCTOR method. A constructor is a special method
#   that is called automatically when a new object is created from a class.
#   Its job is to INITIALISE (set up) the object's attributes with starting values.
#
# WHY DO WE NEED IT?
#   Without __init__, every object would start empty with no data.
#   __init__ lets you pass values at creation time to give the object
#   meaningful starting state.
#
# SYNTAX BREAKDOWN:
#   def __init__(self, param1, param2):
#       self.param1 = param1   ← stores the passed value as an attribute
#
#   - 'self'   → always the first parameter; refers to the new object
#   - param1   → additional parameters you decide (just like a normal function)
#   - self.x   → creates an ATTRIBUTE named 'x' on this object
#
# IMPORTANT: You never call __init__ manually. Python calls it for you when
#            you write:  obj = MyClass(arg1, arg2)

class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, age, marks):
        # These three lines SET UP the object with the provided data
        self.name  = name    # who the student is
        self.age   = age     # how old they are
        self.marks = marks   # their score

    def grade(self):
        # Method that COMPUTES a result using the object's own data (self.marks)
        if self.marks >= 90:
            return "A+"
        elif self.marks >= 75:
            return "A"
        elif self.marks >= 60:
            return "B"
        else:
            return "C"

    def display(self):
        # Prints a formatted report for this student
        print(f"Student : {self.name}")
        print(f"Age     : {self.age}")
        print(f"Marks   : {self.marks}")
        print(f"Grade   : {self.grade()}")   # calls another method on self
        print()

# Each Student object is created with its own name, age, and marks
s1 = Student("Yash",     20, 92)   # __init__ runs, sets self.name="Yash" etc.
s2 = Student("Prashant", 21, 78)
s3 = Student("Rohit",    19, 55)

s1.display()
s2.display()
s3.display()


# =============================================================================
# 3. CLASS ATTRIBUTE vs INSTANCE ATTRIBUTE
# =============================================================================
#
# INSTANCE ATTRIBUTE:
#   - Defined inside __init__ using self.attribute_name
#   - Unique to EACH object — every object has its own copy
#   - Changing it on one object does NOT affect others
#   - Example: each Circle has its own radius
#
# CLASS ATTRIBUTE:
#   - Defined directly inside the class body (NOT inside any method)
#   - SHARED across ALL objects of that class — there is only one copy
#   - Changing it affects every instance (unless the instance overrides it)
#   - Useful for constants or counters that belong to the class itself
#   - Access via ClassName.attribute or self.attribute
#
# ANALOGY:
#   Class attribute  = A school's name (same for all students)
#   Instance attribute = Each student's own roll number (unique per student)

class Circle:
    pi = 3.14159   # CLASS ATTRIBUTE: the value of π is the same for all circles

    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius   # INSTANCE ATTRIBUTE: each circle has a different radius

    def area(self):
        # Circle.pi accesses the class attribute explicitly
        return Circle.pi * self.radius ** 2

    def circumference(self):
        return 2 * Circle.pi * self.radius


c1 = Circle(5)
c2 = Circle(10)

print(c1.area())            # 78.53975   — uses c1's radius (5)
print(c2.area())            # 314.159    — uses c2's radius (10)
print(Circle.pi)            # 3.14159    — access class attribute via class name
print(c1.pi)                # 3.14159    — also accessible via instance (Python checks class if not on instance)


# =============================================================================
# 4. METHODS — Types
# =============================================================================
#
# A METHOD is a function defined inside a class. There are three types:
#
# ┌─────────────────┬────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
# │ Type            │ Description                                            │
# ├─────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
# │ Instance Method │ Most common. Needs 'self'. Works on a specific object. │
# │                 │ Can read/modify instance attributes.                   │
# ├─────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
# │ Class Method    │ Decorated with @classmethod. Gets 'cls' (the class     │
# │                 │ itself) as first arg instead of 'self'. Works on       │
# │                 │ class-level data. Called on the class: Class.method()  │
# ├─────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
# │ Static Method   │ Decorated with @staticmethod. Gets NO automatic arg.   │
# │                 │ A plain utility function that lives inside the class   │
# │                 │ for organisational reasons. No access to instance or   │
# │                 │ class data unless passed explicitly.                   │
# └─────────────────┴────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

class BankAccount:
    bank_name = "Python Bank"   # class attribute — shared by all accounts

    def __init__(self, owner, balance=0):
        self.owner   = owner      # who owns this account
        self.balance = balance    # starting balance (default 0)

    # ── INSTANCE METHOD ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    # Works on a SPECIFIC account. 'self' lets it read/change that account's data.
    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.balance += amount
        print(f"Deposited ₹{amount}. New balance: ₹{self.balance}")

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount > self.balance:
            print("Insufficient balance!")
        else:
            self.balance -= amount
            print(f"Withdrew ₹{amount}. New balance: ₹{self.balance}")

    def show_balance(self):
        print(f"{self.owner}'s balance: ₹{self.balance}")

    # ── CLASS METHOD ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    # Works on the CLASS itself, not a specific account.
    # 'cls' refers to BankAccount (the class), not any particular object.
    # Use case: factory methods, modifying class-level data.
    @classmethod
    def get_bank_name(cls):
        return cls.bank_name

    @classmethod
    def change_bank_name(cls, new_name):
        cls.bank_name = new_name   # changes the shared class attribute

    # ── STATIC METHOD ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    # No 'self' or 'cls'. Pure utility function grouped inside the class.
    # Cannot access or modify instance/class data. Like a helper function.
    @staticmethod
    def is_valid_amount(amount):
        return amount > 0   # simple validation — doesn't need any object data


# Using the BankAccount class
acc1 = BankAccount("Yash", 1000)
acc2 = BankAccount("Prashant", 5000)

acc1.deposit(500)        # Deposited ₹500. New balance: ₹1500
acc1.withdraw(200)       # Withdrew ₹200. New balance: ₹1300
acc2.show_balance()      # Prashant's balance: ₹5000

print(BankAccount.get_bank_name())           # Python Bank
BankAccount.change_bank_name("PyBank")       # changes for ALL accounts
print(BankAccount.get_bank_name())           # PyBank

print(BankAccount.is_valid_amount(100))      # True
print(BankAccount.is_valid_amount(-50))      # False


# =============================================================================
# 5. ENCAPSULATION — hiding internal data
# =============================================================================
#
# DEFINITION:
#   Encapsulation is the OOP principle of BUNDLING related data (attributes)
#   and behaviour (methods) into a single unit (a class), AND controlling
#   how that data is accessed or modified from the outside world.
#
# WHY IT MATTERS:
#   Without encapsulation, any part of your program could accidentally (or
#   intentionally) modify an object's internal data in an invalid way.
#   Example: setting someone's age to -5, or a bank balance to a string.
#   Encapsulation lets you add VALIDATION and PROTECTION via controlled access.
#
# THINK OF IT LIKE:
#   An ATM machine. You can deposit/withdraw money (controlled methods),
#   but you cannot directly reach into the machine and change the numbers.
#   The internal mechanisms are hidden; you interact only through the interface.
#
# Python naming conventions for access control:
#   self.name    → PUBLIC     — anyone can read/write directly. No restriction.
#   self._name   → PROTECTED  — a convention (not enforced). Means "for internal
#                               use; don't touch from outside unless you know what
#                               you're doing." Other programmers will respect this.
#   self.__name  → PRIVATE    — Python applies "name mangling", renaming it to
#                               _ClassName__name. Prevents accidental access from
#                               outside the class. Enforced (but not unbreakable).
#
# GETTERS and SETTERS are methods that provide controlled access to private data.
#   Getter → reads the private value
#   Setter → validates and sets the private value

class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age, salary):
        self.name      = name       # PUBLIC: freely accessible
        self._age      = age        # PROTECTED: accessible but use with caution
        self.__salary  = salary     # PRIVATE: hidden, use getter/setter

    def get_salary(self):           # GETTER — safely returns the private value
        return self.__salary

    def set_salary(self, amount):   # SETTER — validates before changing
        if amount > 0:
            self.__salary = amount
            print(f"Salary updated to ₹{self.__salary}")
        else:
            print("Salary must be positive!")   # invalid input rejected

    def display(self):
        print(f"{self.name} | Age: {self._age} | Salary: ₹{self.__salary}")


p = Person("Yash", 20, 50000)

print(p.name)          # Yash          ✅ public — direct access fine
print(p._age)          # 20            ⚠️  protected — works but discouraged
# print(p.__salary)    # ❌ AttributeError: __salary is name-mangled, hidden

print(p.get_salary())  # 50000         ✅ use the getter for safe access
p.set_salary(60000)                    # ✅ use the setter (with validation)
p.display()


# ── @property — The Pythonic (elegant) way to write getters/setters ───────────
#
# Instead of writing get_celsius() and set_celsius() as separate methods,
# Python's @property decorator lets you ACCESS them like plain attributes
# while still running validation code behind the scenes.
#
# This means:  t.celsius = 100   looks like attribute assignment
#              but actually CALLS the setter method underneath.
#
# This is considered cleaner and more "Pythonic" than explicit get/set methods.

class Temperature:
    def __init__(self, celsius):
        self.__celsius = celsius    # private storage

    @property
    def celsius(self):              # GETTER: accessed as t.celsius (no parentheses!)
        return self.__celsius

    @celsius.setter
    def celsius(self, value):       # SETTER: called when you do t.celsius = value
        if value < -273.15:
            print("Temperature below absolute zero is not possible!")
        else:
            self.__celsius = value

    @property
    def fahrenheit(self):           # READ-ONLY property: computed, no setter defined
        return (self.__celsius * 9/5) + 32


t = Temperature(25)
print(t.celsius)       # 25     — looks like attribute access, calls getter
print(t.fahrenheit)    # 77.0   — computed on the fly, no separate storage
t.celsius = 100        # looks like assignment, actually calls the setter
print(t.celsius)       # 100
t.celsius = -300       # Temperature below absolute zero is not possible!


# =============================================================================
# 6. INHERITANCE — reusing code from a parent class
# =============================================================================
#
# DEFINITION:
#   Inheritance is a mechanism where a CHILD class (also called subclass or
#   derived class) automatically inherits all attributes and methods from a
#   PARENT class (also called superclass or base class).
#
# WHY IT'S USEFUL:
#   Without inheritance, if you had Dog, Cat, and Lion classes, you would
#   repeat the same 'name', 'sound', 'eat()' code three times.
#   With inheritance, you write it ONCE in Animal, and all three classes get
#   it for free. This follows the DRY principle: "Don't Repeat Yourself."
#
# KEY CONCEPTS:
#   - Child gets everything the parent has
#   - Child can ADD new methods of its own
#   - Child can OVERRIDE (replace) parent methods with custom behaviour
#   - super() is used to call the parent's version of a method
#
# SYNTAX:
#   class Child(Parent):    ← the parent goes in parentheses
#       ...
#
# TYPES OF INHERITANCE:
#   Single inheritance    → one parent:    class Dog(Animal)
#   Multi-level           → chain:         class GuideDog(Dog(Animal))
#   Multiple inheritance  → two parents:   class C(A, B)

# ── Parent class ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name, sound):
        self.name  = name
        self.sound = sound

    def speak(self):
        print(f"{self.name} says {self.sound}!")

    def eat(self):
        print(f"{self.name} is eating.")


# ── Child classes ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
class Dog(Animal):
    def __init__(self, name):
        # super().__init__() calls the PARENT'S __init__
        # This prevents rewriting the same name/sound setup code
        super().__init__(name, "Woof")

    def fetch(self):     # NEW method — only Dog has this, not other Animals
        print(f"{self.name} fetches the ball!")


class Cat(Animal):
    def __init__(self, name):
        super().__init__(name, "Meow")

    def purr(self):      # NEW method — only Cat has this
        print(f"{self.name} purrs...")


class Lion(Animal):
    def __init__(self, name):
        super().__init__(name, "Roar")

    # METHOD OVERRIDE — replace the parent's speak() with a custom version
    # When lion.speak() is called, THIS version runs, not Animal's version
    def speak(self):
        print(f"The mighty {self.name} ROARS loudly!")


dog  = Dog("Bruno")
cat  = Cat("Whiskers")
lion = Lion("Simba")

dog.speak()     # Bruno says Woof!            — from Animal (inherited)
cat.speak()     # Whiskers says Meow!         — from Animal (inherited)
lion.speak()    # The mighty Simba ROARS loudly!  — overridden in Lion

dog.eat()       # Bruno is eating.            — inherited from Animal
dog.fetch()     # Bruno fetches the ball!     — Dog-only method
cat.purr()      # Whiskers purrs...           — Cat-only method

# isinstance() checks if an object is of a given class (or its parent classes)
print(isinstance(dog, Dog))     # True  — dog IS a Dog
print(isinstance(dog, Animal))  # True  — Dog is a subclass of Animal, so dog IS also an Animal
print(issubclass(Dog, Animal))  # True  — Dog is a subclass of Animal


# ── Multi-level inheritance ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Inheritance chain: Vehicle → Car → ElectricCar
# Each level adds more specific attributes and methods.
# An ElectricCar object has access to methods from ALL three levels.

class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, brand):
        self.brand = brand

    def start(self):
        print(f"{self.brand} engine started.")


class Car(Vehicle):
    def __init__(self, brand, model):
        super().__init__(brand)     # calls Vehicle.__init__
        self.model = model

    def drive(self):
        print(f"Driving {self.brand} {self.model}.")


class ElectricCar(Car):
    def __init__(self, brand, model, battery):
        super().__init__(brand, model)   # calls Car.__init__ (which calls Vehicle.__init__)
        self.battery = battery

    def charge(self):
        print(f"Charging {self.brand} {self.model} ({self.battery} kWh battery).")


tesla = ElectricCar("Tesla", "Model 3", 75)
tesla.start()    # Tesla engine started.             ← from Vehicle
tesla.drive()    # Driving Tesla Model 3.            ← from Car
tesla.charge()   # Charging Tesla Model 3 (75 kWh). ← from ElectricCar


# =============================================================================
# 7. POLYMORPHISM — same method, different behaviour
# =============================================================================
#
# DEFINITION:
#   Polymorphism (from Greek: "poly" = many, "morphos" = form) means the ability
#   of different objects to respond to the SAME method call in DIFFERENT ways.
#
# IN PRACTICE:
#   You write code that calls shape.area() — without caring whether 'shape'
#   is a Circle, Rectangle, or Triangle. Each class implements area() its own
#   way. The caller doesn't need to know WHICH type it is — just that it has
#   an area() method. This makes your code flexible and extensible.
#
# HOW IT WORKS IN PYTHON:
#   1. Method Overriding  → child class redefines a parent's method
#   2. Duck Typing        → any object with the right method name will work,
#                           regardless of its actual class/type
#
# ANALOGY:
#   Think of a universal remote. Pressing "play" works on a DVD player,
#   a Blu-ray player, and a streaming device — each responds differently
#   to the same button, but you don't need separate remotes.

class Shape:
    def area(self):
        pass   # acts as a placeholder; child classes will override this

class Rectangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, l, w):
        self.l, self.w = l, w

    def area(self):
        return self.l * self.w          # length × width

class Triangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, base, height):
        self.base   = base
        self.height = height

    def area(self):
        return 0.5 * self.base * self.height   # ½ × base × height

class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius

    def area(self):
        return 3.14159 * self.radius ** 2     # π × r²


# This function works with ANY Shape — it doesn't care what specific type it is.
# This is polymorphism in action: same call (shape.area()), different result.
def print_area(shape):
    print(f"Area: {shape.area():.2f}")

shapes = [Rectangle(4, 5), Triangle(6, 8), Circle(7)]

for s in shapes:
    print_area(s)

# Area: 24.00
# Area: 153.94


# ── Duck Typing — Python's flexible form of polymorphism ──────────────────────
#
# "If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck."
#
# In Python, you don't need a shared parent class or formal interface.
# If an object HAS the method being called, Python will call it.
# It checks for the METHOD'S EXISTENCE, not the object's CLASS or TYPE.
# This is a powerful and unique feature of dynamically-typed languages.

class Printer:
    def print_doc(self):
        print("Printer is printing a document.")

class Scanner:
    def print_doc(self):
        print("Scanner is displaying a scan.")

class PDF:
    def print_doc(self):
        print("PDF viewer is rendering a page.")

# Printer, Scanner, PDF are UNRELATED classes — no shared parent.
# But because they all have print_doc(), the loop works perfectly.
devices = [Printer(), Scanner(), PDF()]

for device in devices:
    device.print_doc()   # same call, completely different behaviour each time


# =============================================================================
# 8. ABSTRACTION — hide complexity, show only essentials
# =============================================================================
#
# DEFINITION:
#   Abstraction is the OOP principle of exposing ONLY what is necessary and
#   HIDING the complex internal implementation details.
#   It defines WHAT an object should do, without specifying HOW it should do it.
#
# HOW IT'S IMPLEMENTED IN PYTHON:
#   Using the 'abc' module (Abstract Base Classes).
#   An ABSTRACT CLASS is a class that:
#     - Cannot be instantiated directly (you can't create objects from it)
#     - Serves as a CONTRACT or TEMPLATE for child classes
#     - Contains one or more ABSTRACT METHODS (declared but not implemented)
#     - Forces every child class to implement those abstract methods
#
#   An ABSTRACT METHOD is a method declared with @abstractmethod.
#   It has no body (just 'pass'). Any class inheriting from the abstract
#   class MUST provide a concrete implementation, or it will also be abstract.
#
# ANALOGY:
#   Think of a "Payment" system. Every payment method (Credit Card, UPI,
#   Net Banking) must be able to pay() and refund(). The abstract class
#   ENFORCES this contract. But HOW each method pays is its own business.
#   Like a job description that says "must be able to cook" but doesn't
#   specify the exact recipes.
#
# DIFFERENCE FROM ENCAPSULATION:
#   Encapsulation = HIDING DATA (private attributes, getters/setters)
#   Abstraction   = HIDING COMPLEXITY (hiding implementation behind a method name)

from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Payment(ABC):           # Inheriting ABC makes this an abstract class
    @abstractmethod
    def pay(self, amount):    # Abstract method: WHAT to do, not HOW
        pass                  # No implementation here — child MUST provide it

    @abstractmethod
    def refund(self, amount):
        pass

    def receipt(self, amount):    # CONCRETE method: implemented here, shared by all
        print(f"Receipt: ₹{amount} transaction processed.")


class CreditCard(Payment):
    # Must implement pay() and refund(), otherwise Python raises TypeError
    def pay(self, amount):
        print(f"Paid ₹{amount} via Credit Card.")

    def refund(self, amount):
        print(f"₹{amount} refunded to Credit Card.")


class UPI(Payment):
    def pay(self, amount):
        print(f"Paid ₹{amount} via UPI.")

    def refund(self, amount):
        print(f"₹{amount} refunded to UPI.")


# payment = Payment()   # ❌ TypeError — cannot instantiate an abstract class
#                         This forces you to always use a concrete child class.

cc  = CreditCard()
upi = UPI()

cc.pay(500)         # Paid ₹500 via Credit Card.
cc.receipt(500)     # Receipt: ₹500 transaction processed.  ← from Payment
upi.pay(200)        # Paid ₹200 via UPI.
upi.refund(200)     # ₹200 refunded to UPI.

# 9. MAGIC / DUNDER METHODS
# =============================================================================
#
# DEFINITION:
#   Dunder = "Double UNDERscore" methods (also called Magic Methods or
#   Special Methods). These are methods with double underscores on both sides:
#   __method_name__
#
# HOW THEY WORK:
#   Python calls these methods AUTOMATICALLY in response to built-in operations.
#   You never call them directly (e.g., you don't write b1.__str__()).
#   Instead, Python triggers them behind the scenes:
#     print(obj)   → calls obj.__str__()
#     len(obj)     → calls obj.__len__()
#     obj1 == obj2 → calls obj1.__eq__(obj2)
#     obj1 + obj2  → calls obj1.__add__(obj2)
#     obj1 < obj2  → calls obj1.__lt__(obj2)
#
# WHY USE THEM?
#   They let your CUSTOM CLASSES work naturally with Python's built-in syntax
#   and functions. Your objects start behaving like built-in types (lists, ints).
#
# COMMON DUNDER METHODS:
#   __init__   → constructor, runs on creation
#   __str__    → human-readable string; used by print() and str()
#   __repr__   → developer/debug string; used in the Python shell
#   __len__    → defines what len() returns
#   __eq__     → defines == comparison
#   __lt__     → defines < comparison (enables sorting with .sort())
#   __add__    → defines + operator behaviour

class Book:
    def __init__(self, title, author, pages):
        self.title  = title
        self.author = author
        self.pages  = pages

    def __str__(self):
        # Called by print(book) — meant for END USERS to read
        return f"'{self.title}' by {self.author}"

    def __repr__(self):
        # Called in the Python interpreter or for debugging — more detailed
        return f"Book(title='{self.title}', author='{self.author}', pages={self.pages})"

    def __len__(self):
        # Called by len(book) — returns the number of pages
        return self.pages

    def __eq__(self, other):
        # Called by book1 == book2 — compares title and author
        return self.title == other.title and self.author == other.author

    def __lt__(self, other):
        # Called by book1 < book2 — compares by page count
        # Required for .sort() to work on a list of Book objects
        return self.pages < other.pages

    def __add__(self, other):
        # Called by book1 + book2 — creates a combined collection string
        return f"Combined: {self.title} + {other.title}"


b1 = Book("Python Basics",    "Yash",  350)
b2 = Book("Advanced Python",  "Yash",  520)
b3 = Book("Python Basics",    "Yash",  350)

print(b1)            # 'Python Basics' by Yash                ← __str__
print(repr(b1))      # Book(title='Python Basics', ...)       ← __repr__
print(len(b1))       # 350                                    ← __len__
print(b1 == b3)      # True   — same title & author           ← __eq__
print(b1 == b2)      # False
print(b1 < b2)       # True   (350 < 520)                     ← __lt__
print(b1 + b2)       # Combined: Python Basics + Advanced Python ← __add__

# .sort() uses __lt__ automatically — no extra code needed!
library = [b2, b1, Book("Django Guide", "Rohit", 410)]

# Q1. Create a class Rectangle with length and width.
#     Add methods: area(), perimeter(), is_square().

# Q2. Create a class Employee with name, department, salary.
#     Add a class method to track total employees.
# ------ Solution ------

e1.details()
print(f"Total employees: {Employee.total_employees()}")   # 2


# Q3. Use inheritance: Animal → Dog → GuideDog.
#     Each level adds one new method.
# ------ Solution ------
class Animal:
    def breathe(self):
        print("Breathing...")   # all animals breathe

gd.guide()     # from GuideDog itself


# Q4. Demonstrate polymorphism: create Parrot, Duck, and Penguin classes,
#     each with a fly() method. Some can fly, some cannot.
# ------ Solution ------
class Parrot:
    def fly(self): print("Parrot flies high!")

# Q5. Create a class with a private __balance attribute.
#     Use a property to get it and a setter to validate deposits.
# ------ Solution ------
